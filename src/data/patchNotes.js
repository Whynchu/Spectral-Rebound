    label: 'THREAT CLEANUP',
    summary: [
      'This patch focused on readability, threat identity, and pruning mechanics that were muddying the arena instead of strengthening it. Transmute and Pulse Mine were removed from the ecosystem, enemy families were pushed back onto the shared hue-shift rules so the selected player color consistently creates the intended visual offset across mobs and hostile projectiles, and triangle shots were enlarged to read faster under pressure.',
      'It also cleaned up a dangerous edge case where triangle wall bursts were visually breaking into harmless-looking grey shots even though they were supposed to stay threatening. Those spawned shots now keep their danger state, which keeps the combat language cleaner and prevents the game from teaching the wrong visual rule.'
    ],
    highlights: [
      'Removed Transmute and Pulse Mine from the boon pool.',
      'Forced enemy and projectile threat palettes to respect the player-color offset everywhere they should.',
      'Triangle projectiles were made larger and their wall-burst followups now remain active danger bullets.',
      'Mirror Tide and Phase Dash were converted into room-limited abilities with cooldowns, preventing infinite abuse loops.'

    version: '1.16.1',
    label: 'HP COLOR',
    summary: [
      'This update was small but important for cohesion. The player HP presentation stopped using the same hard-coded green for every run and began inheriting the currently selected player accent instead, which keeps the HUD aligned with the chosen character color and makes the whole run presentation feel more intentional.',
      'The warning readability was preserved, so medium and critical health still transition into the existing caution colors rather than becoming too decorative to parse in motion.'
    ],
    highlights: [
      'Player HP now inherits the active player color instead of defaulting to green.',
      'Low-health warning states still shift into yellow and red for clarity.'
